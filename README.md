the aim of this repository is to create a daiy planner for work hours which saves data based on user input

user input is aimed to be saved into local storage and remain on the page despite refreshes

the classes on the div files also need to be made dynamic based on the time time of day

this was done with the use of the Day js API to receieve data on the current time 

in addition to this, the day js API was used in order to present the current date inside the header as well

Problems remaining: issues involving saving data to local stoarge in order to keep it on the webpage
